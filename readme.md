## What is it?

This is essentially a Web App in a box, front and back end, built with the magic of Docker üê≥

We have an ExpressJS Web API, using WebSQL for it's data store.

![demo]

The front end is React based and there is also a pre-configured phpMyAdmin instance to compliment the setup, all running in an isolated environment in the root of the project!

## What does it do?

Whatever you want it to do really, the idea is, it's a simple, easy and fast full stack javascript web app in a box, front end, back end and DB included!

No mucking around! üéâ

---

## Quick Start Usage


### Create a .env config

Create a file at `./api/.env` and populate the contents like so, setting a password of your choosing:-

_This file is .gitignored_

```.env
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USERNAME='root'
DB_PASSWORD='some_wi1d-pa$$word'
DB_DATABASE=nodeDB
DB_HOST=react-express-mysql
```

### Run the solution using Docker üê≥

Run this solution using Docker, WSL2 and your distro of preference.

```bash
# Start the solution (-d for detached mode)
docker-compose up

# Stop the solution (Ctrl+C)
docker-compose down
```

### What now?

The api is hosted on port 9000, the front end on port 80

This can be customized via env variables, but those are the defaults.

Once you have the solution up and running, simply visit http://localhost/TestAPI to check it's working correctly, and begin developing the API and Front End.

## Development Info

The React front end is currently happy to run standalone from it's root `./client`.

Working with the api `./api` is not currently recommended since the docker build provides your data store in MySQL.

You can get around this if you are handy with docker, simply spin up the mysql service with custom compose file.

### Running the front or back end standalone:

```bash
# Start Front End Dev Server Only
cd client && npm start

# Start Back End Dev Server Only
cd api && npm run dev
```

### Docker: Running the full solution

```bash
# Ensure you have docker installed & running
# It's recommended to use WSL2 with Ubuntu LTS

# Run the solution
docker-compose up

# Launch docker container (-d: detached)
docker-compose up -d

# Kill the solution
docker-compose down

# Build the containers
docker-compose build

# Recreate the solution & run
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate

# We can then also do (due to docker-componse `container_name: node-mysql`)
docker start react-express-mysql

# Exec commands in the container:
docker exec -it [container_name] mysql -uroot -p
```

### Backing up your database

The database is defined in `./docker-compose.yml`

The MySQL instance is volume bound to: `./docker-volumes` and is also in `.gitignore`
